# READ ME: PiFi

The PiFi has been built on top of the open source code provided by The Piratebox Project— A self contained mobile communication and file sharing system. Users can wirelessly connect to the piratebox and share or access images, videos, audio, documents and other digital content.

You can find more details about the original Piratebox project <a href="https://piratebox.cc/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The PiFi is an ongoing project that uses the Piratebox code as it’s starting point. The goal with this project is to design a device that addresses the information sharing needs of the people in rural India, where internet generally tends to be poor, or sometimes non-existent.

As we add newer features and functionalities to PiFi, we shall keep updating this readme file to appropriately guide any reader to be able to source the required hardware, software, and replicate the PiFi to whatever level of sophistication it stands at, at our end.

### Who is this Read Me for?

This readme has been written with the intention that even someone with little to no knowledge of the UNIX command line interface (and code in general), can follow, and successfully configure PiFi v 1.0. If this is still not comprehensive, or if at all, too detailed, then please let us know! Any and all kinds of feedback are welcome.

### Current Versions

Currently we have built 2 versions. Each are being used / have been used for their own separate applications. If you enter the version folder in this repo, you will find a step by step guide that shall help you set up that particular PiFi. Enjoy!
